## 🎮 Description

**Chicken Ghost Buster** is a text-based adventure game written in Python. Your mission is to explore different rooms of a haunted house and collect **six magical amulets** to defeat an evil entity before it turns you into fried chicken.

Navigate using cardinal directions and pick up items along the way — but choose wisely! If you reach the Dining Room without collecting all the amulets, you’ll face a fiery end.

## 🧭 How to Play

- Use the following **movement commands** to explore:
  - `North`, `South`, `East`, `West`

- To collect items, use the command format:
  - `get item-name`  
    _(Example: `get Aztec Medallion`)_

- If you collect all **six amulets**, you win the game.
- If you reach the **Dining Room** without them, it's Game Over.
- You can find an **exit** through the **Patio**.
- Type `quit` at any time to end the game.
